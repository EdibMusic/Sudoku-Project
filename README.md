# Sudoku-Project

When you go to the github repository we provided, on the top right hand corner of the screen, there is a button that says "Fork". That will fork the repo to your own github
Use the link https://github.com/new/import to clone your forked repo to make it private. You will work on the project by adding your own files to this private repository.
